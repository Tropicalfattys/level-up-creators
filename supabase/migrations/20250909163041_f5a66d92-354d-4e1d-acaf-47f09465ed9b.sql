To get verified, simply:
1. Post your unique LeveledUp referral link on at least one major social platform (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn).
2. Post the same referral link on a second platform â€” this can be your Discord server, YouTube channel, or another major platform you didn''t use in Step 1.

Once both posts are live, submit the links in your Creator Dashboard. Our team will review and confirm your verification.

Start building trust and stand out with the verification badge today!'
