-- Add a more restrictive policy for public creator access
-- This ensures only approved creators are visible publicly through safe channels
CREATE POLICY "Approved creators basic info viewable by everyone" 
ON public.creators 
FOR SELECT 
USING (approved = true);

-- The remaining policies on creators table ensure security:
-- 1. "Admins have full access to creators" - admins can see everything including payout addresses
-- 2. "Users can create their creator profile" - users can create their profile
-- 3. "Users can update their creator profile" - users can update their own profile
-- 4. New policy above - only approved creators' basic info visible publicly

-- This ensures that:
-- 1. Payout addresses are only accessible to admins and the creator themselves
-- 2. Public access gets safe data through the security definer function
-- 3. The new restrictive policy prevents unauthorized access to sensitive fields
